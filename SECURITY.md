# Security Policy

We take security reports seriously and will work with you to resolve issues quickly and fairly.

## Supported versions
We fix security issues on the default branch and the latest release. Backports may be considered for the previous release if the fix is low risk.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue and the potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or proof of concept
- Affected commit or version if known
- Your contact information and a public key if you prefer encrypted replies

Preferred language is English.

## Safe harbor
We will not pursue legal action for good faith research and disclosure that follows this policy. Avoid accessing personal data, disrupting production services, or violating laws.

## Response timeline
- **Acknowledgement** within 3 business days
- **Triage** within 7 business days
- **Fix** timeline depends on severity and complexity. We aim for quick patches for critical issues.

We will keep you informed of progress and credit you if desired after a coordinated release.

## Questions
If you have general questions, open an issue and use the security label.
