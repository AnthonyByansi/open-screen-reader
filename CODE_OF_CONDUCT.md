# Code of Conduct

This project follows the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct. We are committed to a welcoming and harassment free community for everyone.

## Our pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment free experience for everyone. We welcome people of all ages, abilities, body sizes, visible and invisible disabilities, ethnicities, sex characteristics, gender identities and expressions, levels of experience, education, socio economic status, nationalities, personal appearances, races, religions, or sexual identities and orientations.

## Our standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Showing empathy and kindness
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Use of sexualized language or imagery and sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment

## Enforcement responsibilities

## Scope
